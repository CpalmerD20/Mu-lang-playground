# Mu Lang Playground

This is an implementation of transpiler to experiment with potential syntax and grammars for Mu lang. To revisit what it means to be a more human readable programming language. Languages like Python and Ruby were developed with this focus in the 90s and the programming landscape has changed a lot since then. [Sample code snippets can be seen here](src/App.mu)


This implementation uses Jlox as a guide for a working interpreter. (1) I wanted to have a project that had recursion as a use case and (2) having Jlox to refer to would hopefully make the project quicker to implement.

## Mu Goals
- To use whole words with clear meaning.
- To be easier for newer developers to learn.
- To have consistent syntax that is easy to visually parse.
- The language prioritizes ease of learning and ergonomics.

## Mu Principles (Far Future Implementation Goals)
- A procedural language that supports first class functions.
- Support for objects without inheritance (traits and composition instead).
- Support for immutable variables and data structures, as well as, atomic variables and data structures.
